## Introduction
In the Philosophers project, we address a classical synchronization issue known as the Dining Philosophers problem. Through this simulation, we aspire to master the fundamentals of threading a process and exploring the intricate details of synchronization primitives.

## Knowledge and Core Principles
Philosophers and their States
> Eating: Philosophers require two forks to eat. Ensuring they eat before a set time limit is essential to prevent them from starving to death.
> Sleeping: After eating, philosophers enter a state of rest to simulate real-life behavior.
> Thinking: Philosophers contemplate in this phase, a crucial state before they begin to feel hungry again.
## Synchronization
The synchronization of various actions is paramount to prevent deadlocks and ensure a fluid simulation, hinting at deeper concepts in multi-threaded programming.

## Fork Management
A detailed management system for fork usage ensures an accurate simulation while preventing resource conflicts, showcasing the importance of resource allocation in programming.

## Logging System
A logging system ensures all state changes are logged accurately and timely, providing insights into the potential issues and status of each philosopher, which is vital in tracking and debugging multi-threaded applications.

## Project Objectives
Understanding Multithreading: The project aims to provide a deep understanding of the complexities involved in multithreading.
Resource Allocation and Synchronization: Learn the art of synchronizing threads and managing resources efficiently to prevent deadlocks.
## Problem-Solving 
Enhance problem-solving skills by coming up with algorithms to solve synchronization issues and ensure a deadlock-free environment.
